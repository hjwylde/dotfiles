[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/1.0.0/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

The dotfiles are structured into _packages_ that may be installed using
    [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/ "stow").

The packages named after Pok√©mon represent computer-specific dotfiles.
An initialisation script is provided, `init.sh` which install their own and some pre-selected
    packages.
