# dotfiles

The dotfiles are structured into _packages_ that may be installed using
    [stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/ "stow").

The packages named after Pok√©mon represent computer-specific dotfiles.
An initialisation script is provided, `init.sh` which install their own and some pre-selected
packages.
